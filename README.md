# NoAPI

The NoAPI library eases the process of getting structured information out of online services (such as Twitter) without using their public API.

Information wants to be free. Users should not be forced to use bloated, non-anonymous, APIs. This being said, behave respectfully and avoid querying their servers every second or on every page load, think about implementing a cache.
